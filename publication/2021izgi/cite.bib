  abstract = "Developmental trajectories of gene expression may reverse in
              their direction during ageing, a phenomenon previously linked to
              cellular identity loss. Our analysis of cerebral cortex, lung,
              liver and muscle transcriptomes of 16 mice, covering development
              and ageing intervals, revealed widespread but tissue-specific
              ageing-associated expression reversals. Cumulatively, these
              reversals create a unique phenomenon: mammalian tissue
              transcriptomes diverge from each other during postnatal
              development, but during ageing, they tend to converge towards
              similar expression levels, a process we term Divergence followed
              by Convergence, or DiCo. We found that DiCo was most prevalent
              among tissue-specific genes and associated with loss of tissue
              identity, which is confirmed using data from independent mouse
              and human datasets. Further, using publicly available single-cell
              transcriptome data, we showed that DiCo could be driven both by
              alterations in tissue cell type composition and also by
              cell-autonomous expression changes within particular cell types.",
