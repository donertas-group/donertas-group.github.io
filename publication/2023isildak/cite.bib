  abstract = "The natural variation in mammalian longevity and its underlying
              mechanisms remain an active area of aging research. In the latest
              issue of The EMBO Journal, Liu et al (2023) analyze gene
              expression levels in 103 mammalian species across three tissues,
              revealing tissue-specific associations between gene expression
              patterns and longevity. Remarkably, the study suggests that
              methionine restriction, a strategy shown to increase lifespan, may
              extend beyond artificial interventions and is similarly employed
              by natural selection.",
