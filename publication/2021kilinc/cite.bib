  abstract  = "We present genome-wide data from 40 individuals dating to
               c.16,900 to 550 years ago in northeast Asia. We describe
               hitherto unknown gene flow and admixture events in the region,
               revealing a complex population history. While populations east
               of Lake Baikal remained relatively stable from the Mesolithic to
               the Bronze Age, those from Yakutia and west of Lake Baikal
               witnessed major population transformations, from the Late Upper
               Paleolithic to the Neolithic, and during the Bronze Age,
               respectively. We further locate the Asian ancestors of
               Paleo-Inuits, using direct genetic evidence. Last, we report the
               most northeastern ancient occurrence of the plague-related
               bacterium, Yersinia pestis. Our findings indicate the highly
               connected and dynamic nature of northeast Asia populations
               throughout the Holocene.",
