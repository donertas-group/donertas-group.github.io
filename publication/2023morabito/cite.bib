  abstract = "Turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri) are naturally
              short-lived vertebrates, recapitulating several aspects of human
              aging, including protein aggregation, telomere shortening,
              cellular senescence, and declined antibody diversity. The
              mechanistic causes of systemic aging in killifish are still poorly
              understood. Here we ask whether killifish undergo significant
              age-dependent changes in the main hematopoietic organ, which
              together could contribute to systemic aging. To characterize
              immune aging in killifish, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing,
              proteomics, cytometry and a functional in vitro assay. Our data
              indicate how old killifish display increased inflammatory markers,
              and while immune cells from adult killifish display increased
              markers of proliferation and replication-independent DNA repair in
              progenitor-like cell clusters, progenitors from old killifish
              display extensive markers of DNA double-strand breaks. In less
              than 10 weeks, killifish undergo several dramatic spontaneous
              aging-related changes in the immune niche, which could be
              functionally linked with its extensive systemic aging and serve as
              targets for anti-aging interventions.",
