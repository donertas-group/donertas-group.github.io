  abstract = "Genetically modified mouse models of ageing are the living proof
              that lifespan and healthspan can be lengthened or shortened, and
              provide a powerful context in which to unravel the molecular
              mechanisms at work. In this study, we analysed and compared gene
              expression data from 10 long-lived and 8 short-lived mouse models
              of ageing. Transcriptome-wide correlation analysis revealed that
              mutations with equivalent effects on lifespan induce more similar
              transcriptomic changes, especially if they target the same
              pathway. Using functional enrichment analysis, we identified 58
              gene sets with consistent changes in long- and short-lived mice,
              55 of which were up-regulated in long-lived mice and
              down-regulated in short-lived mice. Half of these sets
              represented genes involved in energy and lipid metabolism, among
              which Ppargc1a, Mif, Aldh5a1 and Idh1 were frequently observed.
              Based on the gene sets with consistent changes, and also the
              whole transcriptome, the gene expression changes during normal
              ageing resembled the transcriptome of short-lived models,
              suggesting that accelerated ageing models reproduce partially the
              molecular changes of ageing. Finally, we identified new genetic
              interventions that may ameliorate ageing, by comparing the
              transcriptomes of 51 mouse mutants not previously associated with
              ageing to expression signatures of long- and short-lived mice and
              ageing-related changes.",
