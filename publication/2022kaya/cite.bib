  abstract  = "The Regional Student Group Turkey (RSG-Turkey) is officially
               associated with the International Society for Computational
               Biology (ISCB) Student Council (SC). At the RSG-Turkey, we aim
               to contribute to the early-career researchers in computational
               biology and bioinformatics fields by providing opportunities for
               improving their academic and technical skills in the field. Over
               the last ten years, we have built a well-known student-driven
               academic society in Turkey that organizes numerous events every
               year and continues to grow with over 650 current members.
               Celebrating the 10th anniversary of RSG-Turkey, in this
               communication, we share our experiences, five main lessons we
               learned, and the steps to establish a long-standing academic
               community: having a clear mission, building a robust structure,
               effective communication, turning challenges into opportunities,
               and building collaborations. We believe that our experiences can
               help students and academics establish long-standing communities
               in fast-developing areas like bioinformatics.",
