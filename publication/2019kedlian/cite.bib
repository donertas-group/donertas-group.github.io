  abstract = "Aging is broadly defined as a time-dependent progressive decline
              in the functional and physiological integrity of organisms.
              Previous studies and evolutionary theories of aging suggest that
              aging is not a programmed process but reflects dynamic stochastic
              events. In this study, we test whether transcriptional noise
              shows an increase with age, which would be expected from
              stochastic theories. Using human brain transcriptome dataset, we
              analyzed the heterogeneity in the transcriptome for individual
              genes and functional pathways, employing different analysis
              methods and pre-processing steps. We show that unlike expression
              level changes, changes in heterogeneity are highly dependent on
              the methodology and the underlying assumptions. Although the
              particular set of genes that can be characterized as
              differentially variable is highly dependent on the methods, we
              observe a consistent increase in heterogeneity at every level,
              independent of the method. In particular, we demonstrate a weak
              but reproducible transcriptome-wide shift towards an increase in
              heterogeneity, with twice as many genes significantly increasing
              as opposed to decreasing their heterogeneity. Furthermore, this
              pattern of increasing heterogeneity is not specific but is
              associated with a wide range of pathways.",
