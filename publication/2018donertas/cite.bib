  abstract = "Aging is the largest risk factor for a variety of noncommunicable
              diseases. Model organism studies have shown that genetic and
              chemical perturbations can extend both lifespan and healthspan.
              Aging is a complex process, with parallel and interacting
              mechanisms contributing to its aetiology, posing a challenge for
              the discovery of new pharmacological candidates to ameliorate its
              effects. In this study, instead of a target-centric approach, we
              adopt a systems level drug repurposing methodology to discover
              drugs that could combat aging in human brain. Using multiple gene
              expression data sets from brain tissue, taken from patients of
              different ages, we first identified the expression changes that
              characterize aging. Then, we compared these changes in gene
              expression with drug-perturbed expression profiles in the
              Connectivity Map. We thus identified 24 drugs with significantly
              associated changes. Some of these drugs may function as antiaging
              drugs by reversing the detrimental changes that occur during
              aging, others by mimicking the cellular defence mechanisms. The
              drugs that we identified included significant number of already
              identified prolongevity drugs, indicating that the method can
              discover de novo drugs that meliorate aging. The approach has the
              advantages that using data from human brain aging data, it
              focuses on processes relevant in human aging and that it is
              unbiased, making it possible to discover new targets for aging
              studies.",
