  abstract = "The archaeological documentation of the development of sedentary
              farming societies in Anatolia is not yet mirrored by a genetic
              understanding of the human populations involved, in contrast to
              the spread of farming in Europe [1-3]. Sedentary farming
              communities emerged in parts of the Fertile Crescent during the
              tenth millennium and early ninth millennium calibrated (cal) BC
              and had appeared in central Anatolia by 8300 cal BC [4]. Farming
              spread into west Anatolia by the early seventh millennium cal BC
              and quasi-synchronously into Europe, although the timing and
              process of this movement remain unclear. Using genome sequence
              data that we generated from nine central Anatolian Neolithic
              individuals, we studied the transition period from early Aceramic
              (Pre-Pottery) to the later Pottery Neolithic, when farming
              expanded west of the Fertile Crescent. We find that genetic
              diversity in the earliest farmers was conspicuously low, on a par
              with European foraging groups. With the advent of the Pottery
              Neolithic, genetic variation within societies reached levels
              later found in early European farmers. Our results confirm that
              the earliest Neolithic central Anatolians belonged to the same
              gene pool as the first Neolithic migrants spreading into Europe.
              Further, genetic affinities between later Anatolian farmers and
              fourth to third millennium BC Chalcolithic south Europeans
              suggest an additional wave of Anatolian migrants, after the
              initial Neolithic spread but before the Yamnaya-related
              migrations. We propose that the earliest farming societies
              demographically resembled foragers and that only after regional
              gene flow and rising heterogeneity did the farming population
              expansions into Europe occur.",
