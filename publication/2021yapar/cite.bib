  abstract = "In independent mammalian lineages where females mate with
              multiple males (multi-male mating strategies), males have evolved
              larger testicles relative to those lineages where females mate
              with fewer males (single-male mating strategies). Here we study
              published bulk testis transcriptomes from humans, chimpanzees,
              gorillas and rhesus macaques, as well as mice and rats. Employing
              a formal model of adaptive evolution, we find that testis
              transcriptomes have also evolved convergently, reflecting each
              species' mating strategy. Using deconvolution, we infer that
              testis transcriptome divergence patterns largely reflect
              convergent shifts in tissue cell type composition. However, we
              also identify modest amounts of convergent evolution at the
              cell-autonomous level by analyzing cell-type specific
              transcriptome data from spermatids and spermatocytes. We further
              show that in the single-male mating primates, human and gorilla,
              testis transcriptome profiles are paedomorphic relative to those
              of multi-male primates, chimpanzee and macaque, suggesting that
              shifts in timing or rate of testis development could underlie
              convergent changes in testis mass, histology, and transcriptomes.
