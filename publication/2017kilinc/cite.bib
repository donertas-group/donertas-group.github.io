  abstract = "The Neolithic transition in west Eurasia occurred in two main
              steps: the gradual development of sedentism and plant cultivation
              in the Near East and the subsequent spread of Neolithic cultures
              into the Aegean and across Europe after 7000 cal BCE. Here, we
              use published ancient genomes to investigate gene flow events in
              west Eurasia during the Neolithic transition. We confirm that the
              Early Neolithic central Anatolians in the ninth millennium BCE
              were probably descendants of local hunter-gatherers, rather than
              immigrants from the Levant or Iran. We further study the
              emergence of post-7000 cal BCE north Aegean Neolithic
              communities. Although Aegean farmers have frequently been assumed
              to be colonists originating from either central Anatolia or from
              the Levant, our findings raise alternative possibilities: north
              Aegean Neolithic populations may have been the product of
              multiple westward migrations, including south Anatolian
              emigrants, or they may have been descendants of local Aegean
              Mesolithic groups who adopted farming. These scenarios are
              consistent with the diversity of material cultures among Aegean
              Neolithic communities and the inheritance of local forager
              know-how. The demographic and cultural dynamics behind the
              earliest spread of Neolithic culture in the Aegean could
              therefore be distinct from the subsequent Neolithization of
              mainland Europe.",
