  abstract  = "Age is a common risk factor in many diseases, but the molecular
               basis for this relationship is elusive. In this study we
               identified four disease clusters from 116 diseases in UK Biobank
               data, defined by their age-of-onset profiles, and found that
               diseases with the same onset profile are genetically more
               similar, suggesting a common etiology. This similarity was not
               explained by disease categories, co-occurrences or disease
               cause--effect relationships. Two of the four disease clusters
               had an increased risk of occurrence from ages 20 and 40 years,
               respectively. They both showed an association with known
               aging-related genes, yet differed in functional enrichment and
               evolutionary profiles. Moreover, they both had age-related
               expression and methylation changes. We also tested mutation
               accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropy theories of aging and
               found support for both. Using genetic and demographic data from
               the UK Biobank, the authors clustered 116 common diseases based
               on their age-of-onset profiles and found increased genetic
               similarity within clusters, suggesting common etiologies. Two of
               the four disease clusters were associated with aging-related
               genes but differed in functional enrichment and evolutionary
               profiles.",
