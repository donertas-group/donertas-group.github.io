  abstract = "It was previously reported that mRNA expression levels in the
              prefrontal cortex at old age start to resemble pre-adult levels.
              Such expression reversals could imply loss of cellular identity
              in the aging brain, and provide a link between aging-related
              molecular changes and functional decline. Here we analyzed 19
              brain transcriptome age-series datasets, comprising 17 diverse
              brain regions, to investigate the ubiquity and functional
              properties of expression reversal in the human brain. Across all
              19 datasets, 25 genes were consistently up-regulated during
              postnatal development and down-regulated in aging, displaying an
              ``up-down'' pattern that was significant as determined by random
              permutations. In addition, 113 biological processes, including
              neuronal and synaptic functions, were consistently associated
              with genes showing an up-down tendency among all datasets. Genes
              up-regulated during in vitro neuronal differentiation also
              displayed a tendency for up-down reversal, although at levels
              comparable to other genes. We argue that reversals may not
              represent aging-related neuronal loss. Instead, expression
              reversals may be associated with aging-related accumulation of
              stochastic effects that lead to loss of functional and structural
              identity in neurons.",
