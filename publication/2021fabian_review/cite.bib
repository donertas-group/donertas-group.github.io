  abstract = "At first glance, longevity and immunity appear to be different
              traits that have not much in common except the fact that the
              immune system promotes survival upon pathogenic infection.
              Substantial evidence however points to a molecularly intertwined
              relationship between the immune system and ageing. Although this
              link is well-known throughout the animal kingdom, its genetic
              basis is complex and still poorly understood. To address this
              question, we here provide a compilation of all genes
              concomitantly known to be involved in immunity and ageing in
              humans and three well-studied model organisms, the nematode worm
              Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,
              and the house mouse Mus musculus. By analysing human orthologs
              among these species, we identified 7 evolutionarily conserved
              signalling cascades, the insulin/TOR network, three MAPK (ERK,
              p38, JNK), JAK/STAT, TGF-$\beta$, and Nf-$\kappa$B pathways that
              act pleiotropically on ageing and immunity. We review current
              evidence for these pathways linking immunity and lifespan, and
              their role in the detrimental dysregulation of the immune system
              with age, known as immunosenescence. We argue that the phenotypic
              effects of these pathways are often context-dependent and vary,
              for example, between tissues, sexes, and types of pathogenic
              infection. Future research therefore needs to explore a higher
              temporal, spatial and environmental resolution to fully
              comprehend the connection between ageing and immunity.",
