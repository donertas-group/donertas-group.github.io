  abstract = "Advancing age is the dominant risk factor for most of the major
              killer diseases in developed countries. Hence, ameliorating the
              effects of ageing may prevent multiple diseases simultaneously.
              Drugs licensed for human use against specific diseases have
              proved to be effective in extending lifespan and healthspan in
              animal models, suggesting that there is scope for drug
              repurposing in humans. New bioinformatic methods to identify and
              prioritise potential anti-ageing compounds for humans are
              therefore of interest. In this study, we first used drug-protein
              interaction information, to rank 1,147 drugs by their likelihood
              of targeting ageing-related gene products in humans. Among 19
              statistically significant drugs, 6 have already been shown to
              have pro-longevity properties in animal models (p < 0.001). Using
              the targets of each drug, we established their association with
              ageing at multiple levels of biological action including
              pathways, functions and protein interactions. Finally, combining
              all the data, we calculated a ranked list of drugs that
              identified tanespimycin, an inhibitor of HSP-90, as the
              top-ranked novel anti-ageing candidate. We experimentally
              validated the pro-longevity effect of tanespimycin through its
              HSP-90 target in Caenorhabditis elegans.",
