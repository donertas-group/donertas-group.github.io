  abstract = "Neanderthals contributed genetic material to modern humans via
              multiple admixture events. Initial admixture events presumably
              occurred in Western Asia shortly after humans migrated out of
              Africa. Despite being a focal point of admixture, earlier studies
              indicate lower Neanderthal introgression rates in some Western
              Asian populations as compared with other Eurasian populations. To
              better understand the genome-wide and phenotypic impact of
              Neanderthal introgression in the region, we sequenced whole
              genomes of nine present-day Europeans, Africans, and the Western
              Asian Druze at high depth, and analyzed available whole genome
              data from various other populations, including 16 genomes from
              present-day Turkey. Our results confirmed previous observations
              that contemporary Western Asian populations, on an average, have
              lower levels of Neanderthal-introgressed DNA relative to other
              Eurasian populations. Modern Western Asians also show
              comparatively high variability in Neanderthal ancestry, which may
              be attributed to the complex demographic history of the region.
              We further replicated the previously described depletion of
              putatively functional sequences among Neanderthal-introgressed
              haplotypes. Still, we find dozens of common
              Neanderthal-introgressed haplotypes in the Turkish sample
              associated with human phenotypes, including anthropometric and
              metabolic traits, as well as the immune response. One of these
              haplotypes is unusually long and harbors variants that affect the
              expression of members of the CCR gene family and are associated
              with celiac disease. Overall, our results paint a complex first
              picture of the genomic impact of Neanderthal introgression in the
              Western Asian populations.",
