  abstract = "Abstract Medawar's mutation accumulation hypothesis explains
              aging by the declining force of natural selection with age:
              Slightly deleterious germline mutations expressed in old age can
              drift to fixation and thereby lead to aging-related phenotypes.
              Although widely cited, empirical evidence for this hypothesis has
              remained limited. Here, we test one of its predictions that genes
              relatively highly expressed in old adults should be under weaker
              purifying selection than genes relatively highly expressed in
              young adults. Combining 66 transcriptome datasets (including 16
              tissues from five mammalian species) with sequence conservation
              estimates across mammals, here we report that the overall
              conservation level of expressed genes is lower at old age
              compared to young adulthood. This age-related decrease in
              transcriptome conservation (ADICT) is systematically observed in
              diverse mammalian tissues, including the brain, liver, lung, and
              artery, but not in others, most notably in the muscle and heart.
              Where observed, ADICT is driven partly by poorly conserved genes
              being up-regulated during aging. In general, the more often a
              gene is found up-regulated with age among tissues and species,
              the lower its evolutionary conservation. Poorly conserved and
              up-regulated genes have overlapping functional properties that
              include responses to age-associated tissue damage, such as
              apoptosis and inflammation. Meanwhile, these genes do not appear
              to be under positive selection. Hence, genes contributing to old
              age phenotypes are found to harbor an excess of slightly
              deleterious alleles, at least in certain tissues. This supports
              the notion that genetic drift shapes aging in multicellular
              organisms, consistent with Medawar's mutation accumulation
              hypothesis.",
