  abstract = "The relationship between enzyme-catalysed reactions and the
              Enzyme Commission (EC) number, the widely accepted classification
              scheme used to characterise enzyme activity, is complex and with
              the rapid increase in our knowledge of the reactions catalysed by
              enzymes needs revisiting. We present a manual and computational
              analysis to investigate this complexity and found that almost
              one-third of all known EC numbers are linked to more than one
              reaction in the secondary reaction databases (e.g., KEGG).
              Although this complexity is often resolved by defining generic,
              alternative and partial reactions, we have also found individual
              EC numbers with more than one reaction catalysing different types
              of bond changes. This analysis adds a new dimension to our
              understanding of enzyme function and might be useful for the
              accurate annotation of the function of enzymes and to study the
              changes in enzyme function during evolution.",
