  abstract = "Transposable elements (TEs) inflict numerous negative effects on
              health and fitness as they replicate by integrating into new
              regions of the host genome. Even though organisms employ powerful
              mechanisms to demobilize TEs, transposons gradually lose
              repression during aging. The rising TE activity causes genomic
              instability and was implicated in age-dependent neurodegenerative
              diseases, inflammation and the determination of lifespan. It is
              therefore conceivable that long-lived individuals have improved
              TE silencing mechanisms resulting in reduced TE expression
              relative to their shorter-lived counterparts and fewer genomic
              insertions. Here, we test this hypothesis by performing the first
              genome-wide analysis of TE insertions and expression in
              populations of Drosophila melanogaster selected for longevity
              through late-life reproduction for 50-170 generations from four
              independent studies. Contrary to our expectation, TE families
              were generally more abundant in long-lived populations compared
              to non-selected controls. Although simulations showed that this
              was not expected under neutrality, we found little evidence for
              selection driving TE abundance differences. Additional RNA-seq
              analysis revealed a tendency for reducing TE expression in
              selected populations, which might be more important for lifespan
              than regulating genomic insertions. We further find limited
              evidence of parallel selection on genes related to TE regulation
              and transposition. However, telomeric TEs were genomically and
              transcriptionally more abundant in long-lived flies, suggesting
              improved telomere maintenance as a promising TE-mediated
              mechanism for prolonging lifespan. Our results provide a novel
              viewpoint indicating that reproduction at old age increases the
              opportunity of TEs to be passed on to the next generation with
              little impact on longevity.",
