  abstract = "Increasing human life expectancy has posed increasing challenges
              for healthcare systems. As people age, they become more
              susceptible to chronic diseases, with an increasing burden of
              multimorbidity, and the associated polypharmacy. Accumulating
              evidence from work with laboratory animals has shown that ageing
              is a malleable process that can be ameliorated by genetic and
              environmental interventions. Drugs that modulate the ageing
              process may delay or even prevent the incidence of multiple
              diseases of ageing. To identify novel, anti-ageing drugs, several
              studies have developed computational drug-repurposing strategies.
              We review published studies showing the potential of current
              drugs to modulate ageing. Future studies should integrate current
              knowledge with multi-omics, health records, and drug safety data
              to predict drugs that can improve health in late life.",
