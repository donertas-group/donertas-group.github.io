  abstract = "Cells in largely non-mitotic tissues such as the brain are prone
              to stochastic (epi-)genetic alterations that may cause increased
              variability between cells and individuals over time. Although
              increased inter-individual heterogeneity in gene expression was
              previously reported, whether this process starts during
              development or if it is restricted to the aging period has not
              yet been studied. The regulatory dynamics and functional
              significance of putative aging-related heterogeneity are also
              unknown. Here we address these by a meta-analysis of 19
              transcriptome datasets from three independent studies, covering
              diverse human brain regions. We observed a significant increase
              in inter-individual heterogeneity during aging (20 + years)
              compared to postnatal development (0 to 20 years). Increased
              heterogeneity during aging was consistent among different brain
              regions at the gene level and associated with lifespan regulation
              and neuronal functions. Overall, our results show that increased
              expression heterogeneity is a characteristic of aging human
              brain, and may influence aging-related changes in brain
              functions.",
