Substantial evidence however points to a molecularly intertwined relationship between the immune system and ageing. Although this link is well-known throughout the animal kingdom, its genetic basis is complex and still poorly understood. To address this question, we here provide a compilation of all genes concomitantly known to be involved in immunity and ageing in humans and three well-studied model organisms, the nematode worm *Caenorhabditis elegans*, the fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster*, and the house mouse *Mus musculus*. By analysing human orthologs among these species, we identified 7 evolutionarily conserved signalling cascades, the insulin/TOR network, three MAPK (ERK, p38, JNK), JAK/STAT, TGF-β, and Nf-κB pathways that act pleiotropically on ageing and immunity. We review current evidence for these pathways linking immunity and lifespan, and their role in the detrimental dysregulation of the immune system with age, known as immunosenescence. We argue that the phenotypic effects of these pathways are often context-dependent and vary, for example, between tissues, sexes, and types of pathogenic infection. Future research therefore needs to explore a higher temporal, spatial and environmental resolution to fully comprehend the connection between ageing and immunity.","tags":["immune system","ageing","model organism"],"title":"Functional conservation in genes and pathways linking ageing and immunity (Review Article)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Etka Yapar","Ekin Saglican","H.

We further show that in the single-male mating primates, human and gorilla, testis transcriptome profiles are paedomorphic relative to those of multi-male primates, chimpanzee and macaque, suggesting that shifts in timing or rate of testis development could underlie convergent changes in testis mass, histology, and transcriptomes.","tags":["testis","transcriptomics","evolution","primate"],"title":"Convergent evolution of primate testis transcriptomes reflects mating strategy (Research Article)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

Transcriptome-wide correlation analysis revealed that mutations with equivalent effects on lifespan induce more similar transcriptomic changes, especially if they target the same pathway. Using functional enrichment analysis, we identified 58 gene sets with consistent changes in long- and short-lived mice, 55 of which were up-regulated in long-lived mice and down-regulated in short-lived mice. Half of these sets represented genes involved in energy and lipid metabolism, among which *Ppargc1a, Mif, Aldh5a1* and Idh1 were frequently observed. Based on the gene sets with consistent changes, and also the whole transcriptome, the gene expression changes during normal ageing resembled the transcriptome of short-lived models, suggesting that accelerated ageing models reproduce partially the molecular changes of ageing.

Even though organisms employ powerful mechanisms to demobilize TEs, transposons gradually lose repression during aging. The rising TE activity causes genomic instability and was implicated in age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases, inflammation, and the determination of lifespan. It is therefore conceivable that long-lived individuals have improved TE silencing mechanisms resulting in reduced TE expression relative to their shorter-lived counterparts and fewer genomic insertions. Here, we test this hypothesis by performing the first genome-wide analysis of TE insertions and expression in populations of *Drosophila melanogaster* selected for longevity through late-life reproduction for 50–170 generations from four independent studies. Contrary to our expectation, TE families were generally more abundant in long-lived populations compared with nonselected controls. Although simulations showed that this was not expected under neutrality, we found little evidence for selection driving TE abundance differences. Additional RNA-seq analysis revealed a tendency for reducing TE expression in selected populations, which might be more important for lifespan than regulating genomic insertions. We further find limited evidence of parallel selection on genes related to TE regulation and transposition. However, telomeric TEs were genomically and transcriptionally more abundant in long-lived flies, suggesting improved telomere maintenance as a promising TE-mediated mechanism for prolonging lifespan. Our results provide a novel viewpoint indicating that reproduction at old age increases the opportunity of TEs to be passed on to the next generation with little impact on longevity.","tags":["transposable elements","ageing","Drosophila","evolution","genomics","transcriptomics"],"title":"Transposable Element Landscape in Drosophila Populations Selected for Longevity (Research Article)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gülşah Merve Kılınç","Natalija Kashuba","Dilek Koptekin","Nora Bergfeldt","H.

As life expectancy increases, ageing poses significant challenges to the individual, society, and healthcare systems. Ageing is a complex process involving multiple interconnected cellular and organismal phenotypes. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms and finding potential interventions is challenging and requires systems-level approaches. In this PhD I have addressed three main questions about ageing, using high-throughput data and computational methods. My first study considers interindividual heterogeneity in gene expression during ageing. Previous studies had suggested that phenotype, epigenome and gene expression become more heterogeneous with age. However, the list of genes and pathways reported as heterogeneous in late age showed differences in the literature and did not resolve whether the increase in heterogeneity is a time-dependent process starting at birth or is restricted to the ageing period (i.e. after 20 years of age). Using different data pre-processing steps and heterogeneity measures on the same transcriptome dataset, we have shown that the inconsistency in the literature could reflect technical issues as well as biological variability. Next, applying a meta-analysis scheme that relies on consistent results across multiple datasets to increase reproducibility, we have shown that the increase in inter-individual heterogeneity starts after the age of 20. Moreover, the genes that become more heterogeneous during ageing have a higher number of transcriptional regulators (miRNAs and transcription factors) and are associated with known longevity pathways. My second study focuses on the link between ageing and age-related diseases. Many diseases show age-dependency, but the molecular nature of this relationship is not fully understood. Using UK Biobank data, I have characterised 116 common diseases based on their age-of-onset profiles and genetic associations. I first showed diseases following the same age-of-onset distribution are genetically more similar, and this similarity could not be explained by disease categories, co-occurrences, or causal relationships. Two groups of diseases showed age-dependent profiles, starting to become more prevalent after the ages of 20 and 40 respectively. They both showed an association with known ageing-related genes but had different functional and evolutionary profiles. I found support for the two evolutionary genetic theories of ageing, mutation accumulation, and antagonistic pleiotropy, using the variants linked to diseases with different age-of-onsets. I also identified some drugs that could be repurposed to target multiple conditions and potentially decrease the need for polypharmacy in the elderly. Finally, I followed a systems-level approach to identify drugs that can target ageing in the human brain. Using transcriptome datasets from multiple brain regions, I first identified the gene expression changes that can characterise ageing. Then, compared with the drug-perturbed gene expression profiles in the Connectivity Map, I identified 24 drugs that are significantly associated with the ageing signature. Some of these drugs may function as anti-ageing drugs by reversing the detrimental changes that occur during ageing, others by mimicking the cellular defence mechanisms. The drugs that we identified included a significant number of already identified pro-longevity drugs, indicating that the method can discover de novo drugs that ameliorate ageing.","tags":["ageing","drug repurposing","heterogeneity","development vs ageing","transcriptomics","genomics","age-related diseases","UK Biobank","GWAS","genomics"],"title":"Computational studies on ageing and age-related diseases (PhD Thesis)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ulas Isildak","Mehmet Somel","Janet M.

The regulatory dynamics and functional significance of putative aging-related heterogeneity are also unknown. Here we address these by a meta-analysis of 19 transcriptome datasets from three independent studies, covering diverse human brain regions. We observed a significant increase in inter-individual heterogeneity during aging (20+ years) compared to postnatal development (0 to 20 years). Increased heterogeneity during aging was consistent among different brain regions at the gene level and associated with lifespan regulation and neuronal functions. Overall, our results show that increased expression heterogeneity is a characteristic of aging human brain, and may influence aging-related changes in brain functions.","tags":["ageing","transcriptomics","heterogeneity","development vs ageing","human","brain"],"title":"Temporal changes in the gene expression heterogeneity during brain development and aging (Research Article)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sayane Shome","R Gonzalo Parra","Nazeefa Fatima","Alexander Miguel Monzon","Bart Cuypers","Yumna Moosa","Nilson Da Rocha Coimbra","Juliana Assis","Carla Giner-Delgado","H.

Although widely cited, empirical evidence for this hypothesis has remained limited. Here, we test one of its predictions that genes relatively highly expressed in old adults should be under weaker purifying selection than genes relatively highly expressed in young adults. Combining 66 transcriptome datasets (including 16 tissues from five mammalian species) with sequence conservation estimates across mammals, here we report that the overall conservation level of expressed genes is lower at old age compared to young adulthood. This age-related decrease in transcriptome conservation (ADICT) is systematically observed in diverse mammalian tissues, including the brain, liver, lung, and artery, but not in others, most notably in the muscle and heart. Where observed, ADICT is driven partly by poorly conserved genes being up-regulated during aging. In general, the more often a gene is found up-regulated with age among tissues and species, the lower its evolutionary conservation. Poorly conserved and up-regulated genes have overlapping functional properties that include responses to age-associated tissue damage, such as apoptosis and inflammation. Meanwhile, these genes do not appear to be under positive selection. Hence, genes contributing to old age phenotypes are found to harbor an excess of slightly deleterious alleles, at least in certain tissues. This supports the notion that genetic drift shapes aging in multicellular organisms, consistent with Medawar's mutation accumulation hypothesis.","tags":["ageing","mutation accumulation","transcriptomics"],"title":"Molecular footprint of Medawar’s mutation accumulation process in mammalian aging (Research Article)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Veronika R.

Using human brain transcriptome dataset, we analyzed the heterogeneity in the transcriptome for individual genes and functional pathways, employing different analysis methods and pre-processing steps. We show that unlike expression level changes, changes in heterogeneity are highly dependent on the methodology and the underlying assumptions. Although the particular set of genes that can be characterized as differentially variable is highly dependent on the methods, we observe a consistent increase in heterogeneity at every level, independent of the method. In particular, we demonstrate a weak but reproducible transcriptome‐wide shift towards an increase in heterogeneity, with twice as many genes significantly increasing as opposed to decreasing their heterogeneity. Furthermore, this pattern of increasing heterogeneity is not specific but is associated with a wide range of pathways.","tags":["ageing","brain","human","heterogeneity","transcriptomics"],"title":"The widespread increase in inter-individual variability of gene expression in the human brain with age (Research Article)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

Model organism studies have shown that genetic and chemical perturbations can extend both lifespan and healthspan. Aging is a complex process, with parallel and interacting mechanisms contributing to its aetiology, posing a challenge for the discovery of new pharmacological candidates to ameliorate its effects. In this study, instead of a target-centric approach, we adopt a systems level drug repurposing methodology to discover drugs that could combat aging in human brain. Using multiple gene expression data sets from brain tissue, taken from patients of different ages, we first identified the expression changes that characterize aging. Then, we compared these changes in gene expression with drug-perturbed expression profiles in the Connectivity Map. We thus identified 24 drugs with significantly associated changes. Some of these drugs may function as antiaging drugs by reversing the detrimental changes that occur during aging, others by mimicking the cellular defence mechanisms. The drugs that we identified included significant number of already identified prolongevity drugs, indicating that the method can discover de novo drugs that meliorate aging. The approach has the advantages that using human brain aging data, it focuses on processes relevant in human aging and that it is unbiased, making it possible to discover new targets for aging studies.","tags":["ageing","drug repurposing","transcriptomics","human","brain"],"title":"Gene expression-based drug repurposing to target aging (Research Article)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gülşah Merve Kılınç","Dilek Koptekin","Çiğdem Atakuman","Arev Pelin Sümer","H.

In this study we identified four disease clusters from 116 diseases in UK Biobank data, defined by their age-of-onset profiles, and found that diseases with the same onset profile are genetically more similar, suggesting a common etiology. This similarity was not explained by disease categories, co-occurrences or disease cause–effect relationships. Two of the four disease clusters had an increased risk of occurrence from ages 20 and 40 years, respectively. They both showed an association with known aging-related genes, yet differed in functional enrichment and evolutionary profiles. Moreover, they both had age-related expression and methylation changes. We also tested mutation accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropy theories of aging and found support for both.","tags":["ancient DNA","Anatolia","population genetics","genomics"],"title":"Archaeogenomic analysis of the first steps of Neolithization in Anatolia and the Aegean (Research Article)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Recep Ozgur Taskent","Nursen Duha Alioglu","Evrim Fer","H.

Initial admixture events presumably occurred in Western Asia shortly after humans migrated out of Africa. Despite being a focal point of admixture, earlier studies indicate lower Neanderthal introgression rates in some Western Asian populations as compared with other Eurasian populations. To better understand the genome-wide and phenotypic impact of Neanderthal introgression in the region, we sequenced whole genomes of nine present-day Europeans, Africans, and the Western Asian Druze at high depth, and analyzed available whole genome data from various other populations, including 16 genomes from present-day Turkey. Our results confirmed previous observations that contemporary Western Asian populations, on an average, have lower levels of Neanderthal-introgressed DNA relative to other Eurasian populations. Modern Western Asians also show comparatively high variability in Neanderthal ancestry, which may be attributed to the complex demographic history of the region. We further replicated the previously described depletion of putatively functional sequences among Neanderthal-introgressed haplotypes. Still, we find dozens of common Neanderthal-introgressed haplotypes in the Turkish sample associated with human phenotypes, including anthropometric and metabolic traits, as well as the immune response. One of these haplotypes is unusually long and harbors variants that affect the expression of members of the *CCR* gene family and are associated with celiac disease. Overall, our results paint a complex first picture of the genomic impact of Neanderthal introgression in the Western Asian populations.","tags":["population genetics","immune system","Neanderthal introgression","ancient DNA","Anatolia"],"title":"Variation and functional impact of Neanderthal ancestry in Western Asia (Research Article)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

Such expression reversals could imply loss of cellular identity in the aging brain, and provide a link between aging-related molecular changes and functional decline. Here we analyzed 19 brain transcriptome age-series datasets, comprising 17 diverse brain regions, to investigate the ubiquity and functional properties of expression reversal in the human brain. Across all 19 datasets, 25 genes were consistently up-regulated during postnatal development and down-regulated in aging, displaying an “up-down” pattern that was significant as determined by random permutations. In addition, 113 biological processes, including neuronal and synaptic functions, were consistently associated with genes showing an up-down tendency among all datasets. Genes up-regulated during in vitro neuronal differentiation also displayed a tendency for up-down reversal, although at levels comparable to other genes. We argue that reversals may not represent aging-related neuronal loss. Instead, expression reversals may be associated with aging-related accumulation of stochastic effects that lead to loss of functional and structural identity in neurons.","tags":["ageing","development vs ageing","transcriptomics","human","brain","reversal"],"title":"Gene expression reversal toward pre-adult levels in the aging human brain and age-related loss of cellular identity (Research Article)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gülşah Merve Kılınç","Ayça Omrak","Füsun Özer","Torsten Günther","Ali Metin Büyükkarakaya","Erhan Bıçakçı","Douglas Baird","H.

Sedentary farming communities emerged in parts of the Fertile Crescent during the tenth millennium and early ninth millennium calibrated (cal) BC and had appeared in central Anatolia by 8300 cal BC. Farming spread into west Anatolia by the early seventh millennium cal BC and quasi-synchronously into Europe, although the timing and process of this movement remain unclear. Using genome sequence data that we generated from nine central Anatolian Neolithic individuals, we studied the transition period from early Aceramic (Pre-Pottery) to the later Pottery Neolithic, when farming expanded west of the Fertile Crescent. We find that genetic diversity in the earliest farmers was conspicuously low, on a par with European foraging groups. With the advent of the Pottery Neolithic, genetic variation within societies reached levels later found in early European farmers. Our results confirm that the earliest Neolithic central Anatolians belonged to the same gene pool as the first Neolithic migrants spreading into Europe. Further, genetic affinities between later Anatolian farmers and fourth to third millennium BC Chalcolithic south Europeans suggest an additional wave of Anatolian migrants, after the initial Neolithic spread but before the Yamnaya-related migrations. We propose that the earliest farming societies demographically resembled foragers and that only after regional gene flow and rising heterogeneity did the farming population expansions into Europe occur.","tags":["ancient DNA","Anatolia","population genetics","genomics"],"title":"The demographic development of the first farmers in Anatolia (Research Article)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

The underlying molecular nature of brain ageing, on the other hand, is little understood, partly due to the stochastic and heterogeneous nature of ageing process. In this study, using published microarray studies spanning 22 brain regions with 1,015 samples, gene expression changes in ageing are analysed in comparison to those in postnatal development. A previous observation that mRNA abundance of a large number of genes in the ageing prefrontal cortex reverses toward pre-adolescent levels, is shown to be a widespread phenomenon across different brain regions. Furthermore, functional analysis reveals that gene expression reversals are consistently associated with decline in neuronal / synaptic gene expression across all studied brain regions, and thus may be linked to ageing-related phenotypes such as decline in cognitive functions. Regulatory analysis show that the genes increasing in expression in development and decreasing in expression in ageing are associated with several trans-regulators, whereas there is no consistent association with any potential trans-regulator for the genes decreasing in expression in development and increasing in expression in ageing. Overall, the results show that meta-analysis is crucial for ageing studies due to the stochastic nature of ageing and that studying gene expression change in ageing in the context of changes in development is a promising approach to discover the molecular mechanisms of ageing.","tags":["ageing","development vs ageing","reversal","transcriptomics","human","brain"],"title":"Meta-analysis of gene expression reversals in ageing brain (MSc Thesis)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.
