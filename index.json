To characterize immune aging in killifish, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing, proteomics, cytometry and a functional in vitro assay. Our data indicate how old killifish display increased inflammatory markers, and while immune cells from adult killifish display increased markers of proliferation and replication-independent DNA repair in progenitor-like cell clusters, progenitors from old killifish display extensive markers of DNA double-strand breaks. In less than 10 weeks, killifish undergo several dramatic spontaneous aging-related changes in the immune niche, which could be functionally linked with its extensive systemic aging and serve as targets for anti-aging interventions.","tags":["killifish","immune system","immunosenescence"],"title":"Spontaneous onset of cellular markers of inflammation and genome instability during aging in the immune niche of the naturally short-lived turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri) (Research Article)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Dönertaş Group will come to life in January 2023 at the Leibniz Institute on Aging - Fritz Lipmann Institute (FLI)!\n","date":1657929600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657929600,"objectID":"3236ee76fd1925ae46d05726079ac297","permalink":"/post/01_establishment/","publishdate":"2022-07-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/01_establishment/","section":"post","summary":"Dönertaş Lab will come to life in January 2023 at Leibniz Institute on Aging - FLI!","tags":null,"title":"Hello, world!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Hamit Izgi","DingDing Han","Ulas Isildak","Shuyun Huang","Ece Kocabiyik","Philipp Khaitovich","Mehmet Somel","H.

Cumulatively, these reversals create a unique phenomenon: mammalian tissue transcriptomes diverge from each other during postnatal development, but during ageing, they tend to converge towards similar expression levels, a process we term Divergence followed by Convergence, or DiCo. We found that DiCo was most prevalent among tissue-specific genes and associated with loss of tissue identity, which is confirmed using data from independent mouse and human datasets. Further, using publicly available single-cell transcriptome data, we showed that DiCo could be driven both by alterations in tissue cell type composition and also by cell-autonomous expression changes within particular cell types.","tags":["mouse","transcriptomics","development vs ageing","DiCo","reversal"],"title":"Inter-tissue convergence of gene expression during ageing suggests age-related loss of tissue and cellular identity (Research Article)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yasin Kaya","Tülay Karakulak","Cemil Can Saylan","E.

Substantial evidence however points to a molecularly intertwined relationship between the immune system and ageing. Although this link is well-known throughout the animal kingdom, its genetic basis is complex and still poorly understood. To address this question, we here provide a compilation of all genes concomitantly known to be involved in immunity and ageing in humans and three well-studied model organisms, the nematode worm *Caenorhabditis elegans*, the fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster*, and the house mouse *Mus musculus*. By analysing human orthologs among these species, we identified 7 evolutionarily conserved signalling cascades, the insulin/TOR network, three MAPK (ERK, p38, JNK), JAK/STAT, TGF-β, and Nf-κB pathways that act pleiotropically on ageing and immunity. We review current evidence for these pathways linking immunity and lifespan, and their role in the detrimental dysregulation of the immune system with age, known as immunosenescence. We argue that the phenotypic effects of these pathways are often context-dependent and vary, for example, between tissues, sexes, and types of pathogenic infection. Future research therefore needs to explore a higher temporal, spatial and environmental resolution to fully comprehend the connection between ageing and immunity.","tags":["immune system","ageing","model organism"],"title":"Functional conservation in genes and pathways linking ageing and immunity (Review Article)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Etka Yapar","Ekin Saglican","H.

Employing a formal model of adaptive evolution, we find that testis transcriptomes have also evolved convergently, reflecting each species’ mating strategy. Using deconvolution, we infer that testis transcriptome divergence patterns largely reflect convergent shifts in tissue cell type composition. However, we also identify modest amounts of convergent evolution at the cell-autonomous level by analyzing cell-type specific transcriptome data from spermatids and spermatocytes. We further show that in the single-male mating primates, human and gorilla, testis transcriptome profiles are paedomorphic relative to those of multi-male primates, chimpanzee and macaque, suggesting that shifts in timing or rate of testis development could underlie convergent changes in testis mass, histology, and transcriptomes.","tags":["testis","transcriptomics","evolution","primate"],"title":"Convergent evolution of primate testis transcriptomes reflects mating strategy (Research Article)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

In this study, we analysed and compared gene expression data from 10 long-lived and 8 short-lived mouse models of ageing. Transcriptome-wide correlation analysis revealed that mutations with equivalent effects on lifespan induce more similar transcriptomic changes, especially if they target the same pathway. Using functional enrichment analysis, we identified 58 gene sets with consistent changes in long- and short-lived mice, 55 of which were up-regulated in long-lived mice and down-regulated in short-lived mice. Half of these sets represented genes involved in energy and lipid metabolism, among which *Ppargc1a, Mif, Aldh5a1* and Idh1 were frequently observed. Based on the gene sets with consistent changes, and also the whole transcriptome, the gene expression changes during normal ageing resembled the transcriptome of short-lived models, suggesting that accelerated ageing models reproduce partially the molecular changes of ageing. Finally, we identified new genetic interventions that may ameliorate ageing, by comparing the transcriptomes of 51 mouse mutants not previously associated with ageing to expression signatures of long- and short-lived mice and ageing-related changes.","tags":["ageing","mouse","lifespan","transcriptomics"],"title":"Transcriptomic profiling of long- and short-lived mutant mice implicates mitochondrial metabolism in ageing and shows signatures of normal ageing in progeroid mice (Research Article)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel K.

Even though organisms employ powerful mechanisms to demobilize TEs, transposons gradually lose repression during aging. The rising TE activity causes genomic instability and was implicated in age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases, inflammation, and the determination of lifespan. It is therefore conceivable that long-lived individuals have improved TE silencing mechanisms resulting in reduced TE expression relative to their shorter-lived counterparts and fewer genomic insertions. Here, we test this hypothesis by performing the first genome-wide analysis of TE insertions and expression in populations of *Drosophila melanogaster* selected for longevity through late-life reproduction for 50–170 generations from four independent studies. Contrary to our expectation, TE families were generally more abundant in long-lived populations compared with nonselected controls. Although simulations showed that this was not expected under neutrality, we found little evidence for selection driving TE abundance differences. Additional RNA-seq analysis revealed a tendency for reducing TE expression in selected populations, which might be more important for lifespan than regulating genomic insertions. We further find limited evidence of parallel selection on genes related to TE regulation and transposition. However, telomeric TEs were genomically and transcriptionally more abundant in long-lived flies, suggesting improved telomere maintenance as a promising TE-mediated mechanism for prolonging lifespan. Our results provide a novel viewpoint indicating that reproduction at old age increases the opportunity of TEs to be passed on to the next generation with little impact on longevity.","tags":["transposable elements","ageing","Drosophila","evolution","genomics","transcriptomics"],"title":"Transposable Element Landscape in Drosophila Populations Selected for Longevity (Research Article)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gülşah Merve Kılınç","Natalija Kashuba","Dilek Koptekin","Nora Bergfeldt","H.

We observed a significant increase in inter-individual heterogeneity during aging (20+ years) compared to postnatal development (0 to 20 years). Increased heterogeneity during aging was consistent among different brain regions at the gene level and associated with lifespan regulation and neuronal functions.

Although widely cited, empirical evidence for this hypothesis has remained limited. Here, we test one of its predictions that genes relatively highly expressed in old adults should be under weaker purifying selection than genes relatively highly expressed in young adults. Combining 66 transcriptome datasets (including 16 tissues from five mammalian species) with sequence conservation estimates across mammals, here we report that the overall conservation level of expressed genes is lower at old age compared to young adulthood. This age-related decrease in transcriptome conservation (ADICT) is systematically observed in diverse mammalian tissues, including the brain, liver, lung, and artery, but not in others, most notably in the muscle and heart. Where observed, ADICT is driven partly by poorly conserved genes being up-regulated during aging. In general, the more often a gene is found up-regulated with age among tissues and species, the lower its evolutionary conservation. Poorly conserved and up-regulated genes have overlapping functional properties that include responses to age-associated tissue damage, such as apoptosis and inflammation. Meanwhile, these genes do not appear to be under positive selection. Hence, genes contributing to old age phenotypes are found to harbor an excess of slightly deleterious alleles, at least in certain tissues. This supports the notion that genetic drift shapes aging in multicellular organisms, consistent with Medawar's mutation accumulation hypothesis.","tags":["ageing","mutation accumulation","transcriptomics"],"title":"Molecular footprint of Medawar’s mutation accumulation process in mammalian aging (Research Article)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Veronika R.

Previous studies and evolutionary theories of aging suggest that aging is not a programmed process but reflects dynamic stochastic events. In this study, we test whether transcriptional noise shows an increase with age, which would be expected from stochastic theories. Using human brain transcriptome dataset, we analyzed the heterogeneity in the transcriptome for individual genes and functional pathways, employing different analysis methods and pre-processing steps. We show that unlike expression level changes, changes in heterogeneity are highly dependent on the methodology and the underlying assumptions. Although the particular set of genes that can be characterized as differentially variable is highly dependent on the methods, we observe a consistent increase in heterogeneity at every level, independent of the method. In particular, we demonstrate a weak but reproducible transcriptome‐wide shift towards an increase in heterogeneity, with twice as many genes significantly increasing as opposed to decreasing their heterogeneity. Furthermore, this pattern of increasing heterogeneity is not specific but is associated with a wide range of pathways.","tags":["ageing","brain","human","heterogeneity","transcriptomics"],"title":"The widespread increase in inter-individual variability of gene expression in the human brain with age (Research Article)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

Model organism studies have shown that genetic and chemical perturbations can extend both lifespan and healthspan. Aging is a complex process, with parallel and interacting mechanisms contributing to its aetiology, posing a challenge for the discovery of new pharmacological candidates to ameliorate its effects. In this study, instead of a target-centric approach, we adopt a systems level drug repurposing methodology to discover drugs that could combat aging in human brain. Using multiple gene expression data sets from brain tissue, taken from patients of different ages, we first identified the expression changes that characterize aging. Then, we compared these changes in gene expression with drug-perturbed expression profiles in the Connectivity Map. We thus identified 24 drugs with significantly associated changes. Some of these drugs may function as antiaging drugs by reversing the detrimental changes that occur during aging, others by mimicking the cellular defence mechanisms. The drugs that we identified included significant number of already identified prolongevity drugs, indicating that the method can discover de novo drugs that meliorate aging. The approach has the advantages that using human brain aging data, it focuses on processes relevant in human aging and that it is unbiased, making it possible to discover new targets for aging studies.","tags":["ageing","drug repurposing","transcriptomics","human","brain"],"title":"Gene expression-based drug repurposing to target aging (Research Article)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gülşah Merve Kılınç","Dilek Koptekin","Çiğdem Atakuman","Arev Pelin Sümer","H.

Initial admixture events presumably occurred in Western Asia shortly after humans migrated out of Africa. Despite being a focal point of admixture, earlier studies indicate lower Neanderthal introgression rates in some Western Asian populations as compared with other Eurasian populations. To better understand the genome-wide and phenotypic impact of Neanderthal introgression in the region, we sequenced whole genomes of nine present-day Europeans, Africans, and the Western Asian Druze at high depth, and analyzed available whole genome data from various other populations, including 16 genomes from present-day Turkey. Our results confirmed previous observations that contemporary Western Asian populations, on an average, have lower levels of Neanderthal-introgressed DNA relative to other Eurasian populations. Modern Western Asians also show comparatively high variability in Neanderthal ancestry, which may be attributed to the complex demographic history of the region. We further replicated the previously described depletion of putatively functional sequences among Neanderthal-introgressed haplotypes. Still, we find dozens of common Neanderthal-introgressed haplotypes in the Turkish sample associated with human phenotypes, including anthropometric and metabolic traits, as well as the immune response. One of these haplotypes is unusually long and harbors variants that affect the expression of members of the *CCR* gene family and are associated with celiac disease. Overall, our results paint a complex first picture of the genomic impact of Neanderthal introgression in the Western Asian populations.","tags":["population genetics","immune system","Neanderthal introgression","ancient DNA","Anatolia"],"title":"Variation and functional impact of Neanderthal ancestry in Western Asia (Research Article)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

Here we analyzed 19 brain transcriptome age-series datasets, comprising 17 diverse brain regions, to investigate the ubiquity and functional properties of expression reversal in the human brain. Across all 19 datasets, 25 genes were consistently up-regulated during postnatal development and down-regulated in aging, displaying an “up-down” pattern that was significant as determined by random permutations. In addition, 113 biological processes, including neuronal and synaptic functions, were consistently associated with genes showing an up-down tendency among all datasets. Genes up-regulated during in vitro neuronal differentiation also displayed a tendency for up-down reversal, although at levels comparable to other genes. We argue that reversals may not represent aging-related neuronal loss. Instead, expression reversals may be associated with aging-related accumulation of stochastic effects that lead to loss of functional and structural identity in neurons.","tags":["ageing","development vs ageing","transcriptomics","human","brain","reversal"],"title":"Gene expression reversal toward pre-adult levels in the aging human brain and age-related loss of cellular identity (Research Article)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gülşah Merve Kılınç","Ayça Omrak","Füsun Özer","Torsten Günther","Ali Metin Büyükkarakaya","Erhan Bıçakçı","Douglas Baird","H.

Sedentary farming communities emerged in parts of the Fertile Crescent during the tenth millennium and early ninth millennium calibrated (cal) BC and had appeared in central Anatolia by 8300 cal BC. Farming spread into west Anatolia by the early seventh millennium cal BC and quasi-synchronously into Europe, although the timing and process of this movement remain unclear. Using genome sequence data that we generated from nine central Anatolian Neolithic individuals, we studied the transition period from early Aceramic (Pre-Pottery) to the later Pottery Neolithic, when farming expanded west of the Fertile Crescent. We find that genetic diversity in the earliest farmers was conspicuously low, on a par with European foraging groups. With the advent of the Pottery Neolithic, genetic variation within societies reached levels later found in early European farmers. Our results confirm that the earliest Neolithic central Anatolians belonged to the same gene pool as the first Neolithic migrants spreading into Europe. Further, genetic affinities between later Anatolian farmers and fourth to third millennium BC Chalcolithic south Europeans suggest an additional wave of Anatolian migrants, after the initial Neolithic spread but before the Yamnaya-related migrations. We propose that the earliest farming societies demographically resembled foragers and that only after regional gene flow and rising heterogeneity did the farming population expansions into Europe occur.","tags":["ancient DNA","Anatolia","population genetics","genomics"],"title":"The demographic development of the first farmers in Anatolia (Research Article)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.
